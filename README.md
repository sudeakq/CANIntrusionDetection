# CAN Intrusion Detection with Machine Learning

This project aims to perform intrusion detection with machine learning algorithms on CAN data using [CAN Intrusion Dataset](https://ocslab.hksecurity.net/Dataset/CAN-intrusion-dataset). Currently, the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm is applied.

## Libraries Used
- **Pandas**: For data processing and analysis.
- **Scikit-learn**: For using machine learning algorithms (especially KNN).
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization.
